## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Instagram
- Tht ability to have disappearing messages
- The ability to change chat background desgins

Spotify
- The ability to save songs offline
- The ability to add and delete songs from playlists

whatsapp 
- The ability to view in both dark and light mode

New App Idea
- I'd like to build an app that allows users to communicate with fictional characters. Users would get to search characters. They would be able to create chats, send messages and receive them from their favorite fictional characters. With this they would also have the chance fo sending voice notes to their favorite fictional characters and receive AI generated responses. This will help users develop a more personal relationship with their favorite characters.
